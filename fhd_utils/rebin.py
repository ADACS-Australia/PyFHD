    """
    Resizes a 2d array by averaging or repeating elements, 
    new dimensions must be integral factors of original dimensions
    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    new_shape : tuple of int
        Shape of the output array in (rows, columns)
        Must be a factor or multiple of a.shape
    sample: bool optional
        Use this to get samples using rebin, rather than interpolation, by default False.
        
    Returns
    -------
    rebinned : ndarray
        If the new shape is smaller of the input array, the data are averaged, 
        if the new shape is bigger array elements are repeated and interpolated
