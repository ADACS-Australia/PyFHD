    A general function for saving a dataset inside a HDF5 File or Group. It's used exclusively for saving
    a dictionary into a HDF5 file, hence why we take a `key` and `value` pair. The `to_chunk` parameter is
    explained in the `save` function, please look there for explanation. In the case of finding a None object
    an Empty Dataset is saved and the is_none is returned as True, so the attribute associated with the key
    can also be set to True to indicate to PyFHD later that the value is meant to be None when reading in the
    dataset again.

    Parameters
    ----------
    h5py_obj : h5py.File | h5py.Group
        A h5py object that has access to the `create_dataset` and `create_group` methods

    value : Any
        The value from the dictionary
    to_chunk : dict[str, dict]
        A dictionary where each key-value pair represents a key in the to_save dictionary, and the value is a dictionary
        which should contain two key-value pairs, `shape` which should be the `shape` of the array and `chunk` which tells
        hdf5 how to chunk the dataset when it's being read/written. If you're not sure how to `chunk` the dataset, set `chunk`
        to True which enables h5py to guess the chunk size for you. By default {}
    variable_lengths : dict[str, DTypeLike]
        A dictionary where each key-value pair represents a key in the to_save dictionary, and the value is a dtype. This is
        for special cases where you must save an array of variable length arrays. H5Py does support variable length arrays, but
        you must use a special type, using the `h5py.vlen_dtype()` you can create a dtype which accepts object arrays of variable
        lengths. For example if you wish to have variable integer array called `ija`, you would use `h5py.vlen_dtype(np.int64)`,
        and save use it in the variable_lengths dictionary like so, `{'ija': h5py.vlen_dtype(np.int64)}`, which will set the dtype appropriately

    HDF5 file contains a single dataset, while a HDF5 which contains multiple
    datasets will load them into a dictionary. Any groups will be convered to
    sub dictionaries using `group_to_dict`

    Parameters
    ----------
    file_name : Path
        The /path/to/the/hdf5.h5
    logger : Logger
        PyFHD's Logger
    lazy_load : bool, optional
        Set to true if you wish to lazy load the file, currently the only file that will be
        supported to do this in PyFHD will be the beam/psf file, but support for other files can
        be done easily enough, by default False


    Returns
    -------
    return_dict | array | h5_file: dict[str, object] | NDArray[Any] | h5py.File
        Returns a dict in the case the HDF5 file contains multple datasets,
        An array if the HDF5 contains one dataset or h5py File object if the
        file is lazy loaded to conserve memory.

def recarray_to_dict(data: np.recarray | dict) -> dict:
    """
    Turns a record array into a dict, but does it as a deep convert. This was needed due to scipy's readsav
    returning an inception like experience of record arrays. This would mean to access values from something
    like the obs structure for a test, the code had to be obs[0]['baseline_info'][0]['tile_a'], which was became
    untenable as the full python translation won't require these leaving us two codebases for IDL compatible and
    Python compatible. Instead, this function turns all record arrays into dictionaries, which are easier to understand
    and are faster.

    This was made specifically to work with the readsav function, to get compatibility with general recarrays remove the
    zero index, as readsav for some reason adds a single dimension to all recarrays.

    This was updated later to also take a dictionary which may contain record arrays too.

    This was also updated later to turn object arrays into multidimensional arrays if they can be one. In the
    case the object array couldn't be turned into a multidimensional array it was turned into a list

    ----------
    data : np.recarray or dict

    Given a path to an IDL style .sav file, load into a python dictionary
    using scipy.io.readsav.

    If the file was saved with the IDL /compress option, the readsav function
    has to save a decompressed version of the file. By default this uses
    the tempfile module to find a location, but this usually finds a bad
    location with little storage when called on a super cluster. So explicitly
    make our own temp dir `tmp_pyfhd` where the code is being called. It is
    assumed many files are to be converted, so `tmp_pyfhd` should be deleted
    after all calls.

    Mostly used just for testing, if you;re not a developer you can safely ignore this function

    ----------
