def create_psf(obs: dict, pyfhd_config: dict, logger: Logger) -> dict | File:
    """
    Creates the psf dictionary by loading in a `sav` or `HDF5` file from a FHD run.
    In the future it would be nice to have the ability to read in a beam fits file.
    Do note, that PyFHD was made with the assumption that the beam is the MWA beam,
    and assumes the beam does not differ on a per baseline basis. If you wish to use
    separate baselines you'll need to add that functionality yourself.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obs : dict
        The observation metadata dictionary
    pyfhd_config : dict
        The PyFHD configuration dictionary
    logger : Logger
        PyFHD's logger

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the beam file type is not recognized or if the beam file path is not set correctly.

    Returns
    -------
    dict | h5py.File
