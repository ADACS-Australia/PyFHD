    """
    Calculates the bins for the histogram and reverse indices based on a 
    minimum and maximum value, plus a given bin size. It mirrors IDL's way of
    calculating the bin edges. In IDL bins seem to be right hand side of the bin open
    like IDL, even at the end. However, in comparison to NumPy, the last bin is always
    the maximum value. This does utilize numba anbd parallelization to make it faster.

    Parameters
    ----------
    min : int, float
        The minimum chosen for the histogram
    max : int, float
        The maximum chosen for the histogram
    bin_size : int, float
        The bin size chosen for the histogram. This histogram alwways uses bins
        of equal widths.

    Returns
    -------
    bins
        A NumPy array of all the bins ranging from min (bin[0]) to the max (bin[-1]). The step
        is bin_size.

def get_ri(data, bins, hist, min, max):
    """
    Calculates the reverse indices of a data and histogram. 
    The function replicates IDL's REVERSE_INDICES keyword within
    their HISTOGRAM function. The reverse indices array which is returned
    by this function can be hard to understand at first, I will explain it here
    and also link JD Smith's famous article on IDL's HISTOGRAM.

    The reverse indices array is two vectors concatenated together. The first vector contains
    indexes for the second vector, this vector should be the size of bins + 1. 
    The second vector contains indexes from the data itself, and should be the size of data.
    The justification for having such an array is to quickly make adjustments to certain bins
    without having to search the array multiple times, thus avoiding multiple O(data.size) loops.

    The first vector indexes contain the starting positions of each bin in the second vector. For example, 
    between the indexes given by first_vector[0] and first_vector[1] of the second vector should be all the 
    indexes of bins[0] from inside the data. So if I wanted to make adjustments to the entire first bin, 
    and only the first bin I can use the reverse indices array, ri to do this. Let's say I wanted to flag
    all values of bins[0] with -1 for some reason to make them invalid in other calculations with the data, 
    then I could do this:

    `data[ri[ri[0] : ri[1]]] = -1`

    Or more generally

    `data[ri[ri[i] : ri[i + 1]]] = -1`

    Where i is 0 <= i <= bins.size.

    If you wish to gain a better understanding of how this get_ri function works, and the associated
    histogram function I have created here, please use the link given in the Notes section. This
    link will take you JD Smith's article on IDL's HISTOGRAM, it is an article which explains the
    IDL HISTOGRAM function better than IDL's own documentation. If you must gain a deeper understanding,
    read it once, gasp and get your shocks and many cries of why out of your system, then read it again.
    And keep reading it till you understand, as per the editor's note on the article:

    "...If you read it enough, the secrets of the command will be revealed to you. Stranger things have happened"

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : np.array
        A NumPy array of the data
    bins : np.array
        A NumPy array containing the bins for the histogram
    hist : np.array
        A NumPy array containing the histogram
    min : int, float
        The minimum for the dataset
    max : int, float

    The weights invert function cleans the weights given by removing
    the values that are 0, NaN or Inf ready for additional calculation.
    If a threshold is set, then we check the values that match the threshold

    Parameters
    ----------
    weights: Complex
        An array of values of some dtype
    threshold: float
        A real number set as the threshold for the array.
        By default its set to None, in this case function checks
        for zeros.
    abs: bool, optional
        Set to False by default. When True, weights are compared against
        threshold or search for zeros using absolute values.

    Returns
    -------
    result: array
        The weights array that has had NaNs and Infinities removed, and zeros OR
        values that don't meet the threshold.

    Python and IDL use the where function on complex numbers differently.
    On Python, if you apply a real threshold, it applies to only the real numbers,
    and if you apply an imaginary threshold it applies to only imaginary numbers.
    For example Python:
    test = np.array([1j, 2 + 2j, 3j])
    np.where(test >= 2) == array([1])
    np.where(test >= 2j) == array([1,2])
    Meanwhile in IDL:
    test = COMPLEX([0,2,0],[1,2,3]) ;COMPLEX(REAL, IMAGINARY)
    where(test ge 2) == [1, 2]
    where(test ge COMPLEX(0,2)) == [1, 2]

    IDL on the otherhand, uses the ABS function on COMPLEX numbers before using WHERE.
    Hence the behaviour we're seeing above.
