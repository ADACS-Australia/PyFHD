    Perform uniform weighting in {u,v} space.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image_uv : np.ndarray
        A 2D {u,v} gridded plane to be filtered
    vis_count : np.ndarray | None
        2D array of number of contributing visibilities per pixel on the {u,v} grid
    obs : dict | None, optional
        Observation metadata dictionary, by default None
    params : dict | None, optional
        Visibility metadata dictionary, by default None
    pyfhd_config : dict | None, optional
        Run option dictionary, by default None
    logger : RootLogger | None, optional
        PyFHD's logger, by default None
    weights : dict | None, optional
        The weights array (aka vis_weights), by default None
    fi_use : dict | None, optional
        Frequency index array for gridding, i.e. gridding all frequencies for continuum images, by default None
    bi_use : dict | None, optional
        Baseline index array for gridding, i.e even vs odd time stamps, by default None
    mask_mirror_indices : bool, optional
        Exclude baselines mirrored along the v-axis, by default False

    Returns

    Raises
    ------
