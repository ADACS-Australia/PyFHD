# PyFHD
Python Fast Holographic Deconvolution

TODO: Add Testing Results and Testing coverage

## FHD
FHD is an open-source imaging algorithm for radio interferometers, specifically tested on MWA Phase I, MWA Phase II, PAPER, and HERA. There are three main use-cases for FHD: efficient image deconvolution for general radio astronomy, fast-mode Epoch of Reionization analysis, and simulation.

PyFHD is the translated library of FHD from IDL to Python, it aims to get close to the same results as the original FHD project. Do expect some minor differences compared to the original FHD project due to the differences between IDL and Python ranging from precision and in many mathematical functions.

## Quick Start
TODO: Add instructions here for getting started

## Useful Documentation Resources
TODO: Incorporate resources from the original FHD repository into here.

## Community Guidelines
We are an open-source community that interacts and discusses issues via GitHub. We encourage collaborative development. New users are encouraged to submit issues and pull requests and to create branches for new development and exploration. Comments and suggestions are welcome.

## Maintainers
FHD was built by Ian Sullivan and the University of Washington radio astronomy team. Maintainance is a group effort split across University of Washington and Brown University, with contributions from University of Melbourne and Arizona State University. 

PyFHD is currently being created by Nichole Barry and Astronomy Data and Computing Services (ADACS) members Joel Dunstan and Paul Hancock. ADACS is a collaboration between the University of Swinburne and Curtin Institute for Computation (CIC) located in Curtin University.
