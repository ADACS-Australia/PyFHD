Started as a project created in IDL, FHD is an open-source imaging algorithm for radio interferometers, 
specifically tested on MWA Phase I, MWA Phase II, PAPER, and HERA. There are three main use-cases for FHD: 
efficient image deconvolution for general radio astronomy, fast-mode Epoch of Reionization analysis, and simulation.
