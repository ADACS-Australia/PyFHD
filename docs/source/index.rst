   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to PyFHD's documentation!

.. note:: PyFHD is still a work in progress but no longer requires IDL to work!

Started as a project created in IDL, FHD is an open-source imaging algorithm for radio interferometers, 
specifically tested on MWA Phase I, MWA Phase II, PAPER, and HERA. There are three main use-cases for FHD: 
efficient image deconvolution for general radio astronomy, fast-mode Epoch of Reionization analysis, and simulation.

Now, FHD has been translated to Python, giving us **PyFHD**, free to use and free of IDL.
