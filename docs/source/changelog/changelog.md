PyFHD 1.0 ðŸŽ‰

The translation from FHD (IDL) to PyFHD (Python) is now mostly complete and runs without needing IDL.

In terms of the FHD pipeline that has been translated we'll go through it bit by bit:

1. PyFHD uses `configargparse` and `yaml` to set all the options for a run, all the options have help text associated with them, coming from the FHD dictionary or comments in the code. The initial setup also setups a logging system using Python's inbuilt logging system giving you control on whether you see the log in the terminal, in a file, or both or neither. 
2. Extracting visibilities data, weights, and parameters,has been fully translated with the exception that the shape of visiblities in general is `[number of polarizations, number of frequencies, number of baselines]` to accomodate the fact that Python is row based vs column based in IDL. The shape change made it easier to translate the indexing across to PyFHD, as the indexing could be translated directly, if you wish to import PyFHD visibilities into FHD at some point, you will need to transpose the baselines and frequencies. 
3. The observation metadata structure/dictionary and the antenna layout structure/dictionary has been recreated as it was in FHD with small changes in names where it made sense and/or values due to the use of libraries like `astropy`.
4. None of the `beam_setup` has been translated in a meaningful way as it was too MWA specific, so the ability to import a beam from a `sav` file or `HDF5` file has been done, however it is going to expect the file to have the same structure as the `psf` structure in `FHD`. Furthermore, the beam HDF5 can be lazy loaded to reduce memory use at the expense of some performance in gridding (takes twice as long in tests). Now that it's possible to use a beam fits in `FHD` and is general enough to work across antennas I'd recommend translating the `beam_fits` branch on the `FHD` repo into `PyFHD`. During the translation of the `FHD` `beam_fits` I'd highly suggest taking advantage of `pyuvdata` and/or `hyperbeam` to create the Jones matrices and to calculate beam areas, as they are well supported and reduce work on your end, allowing you to focus on translating functions like `beam_power` and focus on the creation of the `beam_arr` itself reducing the translation work to roughly 1000 lines of code.
5. Basic Flagging has been translated directly into PyFHD, and `vis_source_model` hasn't been translated as other libraries like WODEN are good for creating visibility models. PyFHD only has the ability to import a visibility model and then flag that visibility model. The Skymodels and Galaxy modelsstructures aren't in PyFHD either, if you want them, I'll leave those translations to you.
6. The entirety of calibration from `FHD` has been translated into `PyFHD`, I don't think a single thing hasn't been translated unless it was completely undocumented with no explanations of its existence or evidence of its use as was the case with some options.
7. Flagging, noise calculation and the updating of the visibility weights post-calibration and pre-gridding has been translated as well
8. Gridding has been translated fully with exception to the mapping function as it was unclear at the time what the best solution was for the sparse matrices that were required. It is clear now the mapping function could be done with a HDF5 file and making sure it can be lazy loaded with chunking with `h5py`.
9. The `fhd_quickview` has many of the pieces left out if as it was a small mess, given you could have the capability to practically skip the whole pipeline and almost re-run the whole thing in just `fhd_quickview`. As such `pyfhd_quickview` focuses more on the saving of the final visibilities, results of gridding and calibration. `pyfhd_quickview` also creates the dirty fits files but not including the stokes due to time constraints. `pyfhd_quickview` also doesn't create much of the plots that are in `fhd_quickview` as many are for diagnostics and may no longer be useful, if you wish to make them, create an option in the configuration and make the plot with explicit reasons for it to exist.
10. `healpix_snapshot_cube_generate` has been translated fully with the ability to make HDF5 Healpix files which should be compatible with any relevant FHD and IDL tools if need be given that IDl has capabilities to read in HDF5 files.

The PyFHD pipeline also has a checkpointing system so you can save checkpoints after creating the `obs` dictionary, calibration and gridding so you can load up previous points and run again if you get a failure after a major processing step. A great example would be if you used a wrong option for gridding or got a failure but the calibration ran fine, you could load the calibration checkpoint and start gridding again.

PyFHD will output everything into a single directory from one run, containing a directory structure itself, please refer to the docs for this directory structure. The docs will also detail the required inputs. Find the docs [here](https://pyfhd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

That should cover the major pieces of the FHD pipeline, other notable pieces of work in `PyFHD` is the replication of IDL's:
* `HISTOGRAM` function with the making of `REVERSE_INDICES` using Numba it's able to produce a histogram and reverse indices array for 1 billion integers in 7 seconds.
* `REBIN` function - Done completely with `NumPy`
* `REGIN_GROW` function - Done with a combination of `NumPy` and `SciPy`

Almost every function that has been translated from FHD or IDL has many tests alongside of it, giving PyFHD a total of 300 tests to give you some confidence that PyFHD does actually match what FHD does down to single precision.

Some bugs that did exist in FHD have been fixed during the translation to PyFHD, these has mostly been passed along and been fixed in `FHD`, there are some mysteries like that of `vis_cal_auto_fit` which seem to work better in PyFHD during tests but we're not sure why.

PyFHD has been tested to run with Python `3.10` and `3.11` (and will probably work with `3.12` once the dependencies have been updated to work with `3.12`) with the following packages as dependencies:
- astropy
- configargparse
- numba
- numpy
- pytest
- pytest-cov
- scipy
- setuptools
- sphinx
- colorama
- importlib_resources
- h5py
- healpy
- sphinx-rtd-theme
- sphinx-argparse
- myst-parser

PyFHD can be installed via `pip` or via `mamba`/`conda`.
