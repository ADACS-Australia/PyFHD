# Change Log

## Unreleased

### Breaking Changes!
* uv plane and image axes have been transposed to put the x axis before the y axis.
This should be transparent to most users, but could cause inconsistencies with
partial re-running of pyfhd jobs from before this change.
* UVBeam files must now be passed using the `uvbeam-file-path` option, which
can take any path on the computer, rather than placing them in a folder in the
repo and passing None to `beam_file-path`.
* The `beam-file-path` configuration option has been renamed to `saved-beam-file-path`
to avoid confusion with the new `uvbeam-file-path` option.

### New Features
* pyfhd can now create model visibilities for calibration using degridding. The
source catalog to be used in degridding must be specified as a file readable by
the pyradiosky SkyModel object to the `calibration-catalog-file-path` option.
A number of source selection options have also been added (see API docs for details).
The top level function for creating model visibilities is in
`src/pyfhd/source_modeling/vis_source_model.py`. Functions to manage the source
catalog creation, DFT sources to the uvplane, convert between Stokes and
instrumental polarization and delay filter the model visibilities are in
`src/pyfhd/source_modeling/source_utils.py`.
* Set up a new test data repo (https://github.com/EoRImaging/pyfhd-datasets),
use pooch to download and cache the test data in testing and in tutorials.
* Added pooch as a testing dependency.
* Added options to `plotting.image.quick_image` to set the color range to clip
outliers based on a number of standard deviations (for log colorbars) or a
percentile range (for linear colorbars).
* Added an option to `plotting.image.quick_image` to set the colormap to any
matplotlib colormap or to match the colormap used in the IDL version of `quick_image`.
* UVBeams are fully and properly integrated. Beam decomposition is implemented
in pyuvdata.UVBeam and just called directly.
* New `uvbeam-file-path` and `uvbeam-freq-buffer` options in configuration.
* Analytic beams (subclassed from pyuvdata.AnalyticBeam) are now supported. Use
the new `analytic-beam-yaml` option to configure them.
* Added handling for `~` in paths in config yamls.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed a couple of bugs in beam and psf setup where the FFT direction or
normalization convention was wrong.
* Fixed a couple small bugs in `plotting.image.quick_image` that caused the
linear scaling to be wrong and the image to be flipped vertically.
* The telescope location is now extracted from the uvfits antenna table, rather
than obtained from astropy's site list, preventing errors when the telescope
is not listed in astropy's site list.
* Fixed a bug in `beam_utils.beam_power` where the beam phase was calculated
improperly, resulting in NaNs.
* Fixed a bug in setting up the gridding kernel that resulted in the kernel not
being centered on the uv space beam.
* Fixed a bug where some pixels slightly below the horizon could be kept,
resulting in beam interpolation errors.
* Fixed a bug in beam setup where the FFT direction was wrong, resulting in
incorrect beam normalization.
* Fixed errors in the calculation of the beam squared area.
* Fixed errors in converting antenna numbers to indices in `obs.create_obs`.
* Fixed errors in calibration plotting with more than 128 antennas.
* Fixed a bug when `split-ps-export` is set to False that resulted in gridding no data.
* Fixed some bugs when `restrict-healpix-inds` is False that caused several errors.
* Removed unimplemented image weighting options in `pyfhd_setup` that resulted in
files claiming to have different image weighting than they actually had.
* Fixed tile height calculation in the case where there is not a metafits file,
e.g. for telescopes other than the MWA.
* Fixed some indexing errors with newer versions of numpy in `vis_calibrate_subroutine`
and `healpix_utils.healpix_cnv_generate`.
* Fixed a problem in `pyfhd_io.save_dataset` where short antenna names caused
h5py errors.
* Fixed a bug in FITS file writing that caused deprecation warnings from astropy.
* Fixed checkpointing to actually work.
* Fixed a bug in the uvfits reader where it assumed the presence of "ra" and
"dec" header items which often present in MWA uvfits files but are non-standard.
* Fixed a bug with newer versions of numpy.
* Fixed `vis_model_transfer` to handle standard IDL FHD folder structure.
* Fixed a bug in `calibration_utils.vis_baseline_hist` where flagging wasn't
fully propagated, causing shape errors.
* Fixed a bug that could cause a KeyError in `pyfhd.main`.
* Fixed a bug that could cause a KeyError in `beam_utils.beam_image`.
* Fixed a bug that caused a numpy indexing error with newer versions of numpy in
`beam_utils.beam_image`.
* Fixed the a bug caused by a bad default value of `baseline_threshold` in
`gridding_utils.dirty_image_generate`.
* Fixed spelling errors in example config yamls.
* Fixed a bug that could cause an undefined variable error in image plotting.
* Fixed a bug in `pyfhd_io.load` that did not properly read HDF5 files created by other writers.

### Test Changes
* Fixed two tests in `test_weight_invert` to handle floating point errors.
* Fixed fixtures in `test_vis_model_transfer` and `test_quickview` to handle
computer-specific paths in test data.

### Dependency Changes
* Added pyradiosky>=1.1.1 as a dependency for managing source catalogs.

### Version Changes

### Translation Changes
* Degridding to create model visibilities has now been translated, along with
various required functions for selecting sources from catalogs, converting from
Stokes to instrument polarization fluxes and DFTing the sources to the uvplane.

## Version 1.0

pyfhd 1.0.1 🎉

The translation from FHD (IDL) to pyfhd (Python) is now mostly complete and runs
without needing IDL.

In terms of the FHD pipeline that has been translated we'll go through it bit by bit:

1. pyfhd uses `configargparse` and `yaml` to set all the options for a run, all
the options have help text associated with them, coming from the FHD dictionary
or comments in the code. The initial setup also setups a logging system using
Python's inbuilt logging system giving you control on whether you see the log in
the terminal, in a file, or both or neither.
2. Extracting visibilities data, weights, and parameters,has been fully translated
with the exception that the shape of visiblities in general is
`[number of polarizations, number of frequencies, number of baselines]` to
accomodate the fact that Python is row based vs column based in IDL. The shape
change made it easier to translate the indexing across to pyfhd, as the indexing
could be translated directly, if you wish to import pyfhd visibilities into FHD
at some point, you will need to transpose the baselines and frequencies.
3. The observation metadata structure/dictionary and the antenna layout
structure/dictionary has been recreated as it was in FHD with small changes in
names where it made sense and/or values due to the use of libraries like `astropy`.
4. Much of the `beam_setup` has been translated using a combination of `pyuvdata`
and translation of FHD in an effort to not have it be too MWA specific, feel free
to experiment with it as it has not been tested and will need additional work
(and potential research to best replace some functions usd in FHD). The ability
to import a beam from a `sav` file or `HDF5` file has been done, however it is
going to expect the file to have the same structure as the `psf` structure in
`FHD`. Furthermore, the beam HDF5 can be lazy loaded to reduce memory use at the
expense of some performance in gridding (takes twice as long in tests).
5. Basic Flagging has been translated directly into pyfhd, and `vis_source_model`
hasn't been translated as other libraries like WODEN are good for creating
visibility models. pyfhd only has the ability to import a visibility model and
then flag that visibility model. The Galaxy models structures aren't in pyfhd
either, if you want them, you will need to translate them or add them in.
6. The entirety of calibration from `FHD` has been translated into `pyfhd`, I
don't think a single thing hasn't been translated unless it was completely
undocumented with no explanations of its existence or evidence of its use as was
the case with some options.
7. Flagging, noise calculation and the updating of the visibility weights
post-calibration and pre-gridding has been translated as well
8. Gridding has been translated fully with exception to the mapping function as
it was unclear at the time what the best solution was for the sparse matrices
that were required. It is clear now the mapping function could be done with a
HDF5 file and making sure it can be lazy loaded with chunking with `h5py`, if
you wish to have the mapping function in an effort to translate the deconvolution
part of the `FHD` pipeline, hope this helps.
9. The `fhd_quickview` has many of the pieces left out given you could have the
capability to practically skip the whole pipeline and almost re-run the whole
thing in just `fhd_quickview`. As such `pyfhd_quickview` focuses more on the
saving of the final visibilities, results of the whole run including gridding and
calibration. `pyfhd_quickview` also creates the dirty fits files but not including
the stokes due to time constraints. `pyfhd_quickview` also doesn't create much
of the plots that are in `fhd_quickview` as many are for diagnostics and may no
longer be useful, if you wish to make them, create an option in the configuration
and make the plot with explicit reasons for it to exist.
10. `healpix_snapshot_cube_generate` has been translated fully with the ability
to make HDF5 Healpix files which should be compatible with any relevant FHD and
IDL tools if need be given that IDL has capabilities to read in HDF5 files. With
that said, the `vis_model_freq_split` function does not pass its tests, which is
the heart of the HEALPIX generation, so if you wish to fix it, please go ahead.

The pyfhd pipeline also has a checkpointing system so you can save checkpoints
after creating the `obs` dictionary, calibration and gridding so you can load up
previous points and run again if you get a failure after a major processing step.
A great example would be if you used a wrong option for gridding or got a failure
but the calibration ran fine, you could load the calibration checkpoint and start
gridding again.

pyfhd will output everything into a single directory from one run, containing a
directory structure itself, please refer to the docs for this directory structure.
The docs will also detail the required inputs. Find the docs
[here](https://pyfhd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

That should cover the major pieces of the FHD pipeline, other notable pieces of
work in `pyfhd` is the replication of IDL's:
* `HISTOGRAM` function with the making of `REVERSE_INDICES` using Numba it's able
to produce a histogram and reverse indices array for 1 billion integers in 7 seconds.
* `REBIN` function - Done completely with `NumPy`
* `REGIN_GROW` function - Done with a combination of `NumPy` and `SciPy`
* `RESISTANT_MEAN` function - Done with `NumPy`

Almost every function that has been translated from FHD or IDL has many tests
alongside of it, giving pyfhd a total of 431 tests to give you some confidence
that pyfhd does actually match what FHD does down to single precision.

Some bugs that did exist in FHD have been fixed during the translation to pyfhd,
these has mostly been passed along and been fixed in `FHD`, there are some mysteries
like that of `vis_cal_auto_fit` which seem to work better in pyfhd during tests
but we're not sure why.

As the developer (Joel Dunstan, [SkyWa7ch3r](https://github.com/SkyWa7ch3r)),
I'd like to thank Nichole Barry for giving me the chance to work on this translation
for many years, it has been rewarding (though sometimes frustrating and challenging!)
work. I'd also like to thank Jack Line who has been crucial at many times working
on pyfhd directly with regards to testing and the translation of the source
modelling. I'd also like to thank Bryna Hazelton for her advice during the
translation effort and providing examples of the use of `pyuvdata` for the `beam_setup`.

If you need to reach me (Joel), I'm on the EoR Analysis slack channel, see you around.
