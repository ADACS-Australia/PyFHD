def splitter(sav_file, save_path):
    """
    The purpose of splitter is to take a large dictionary read from a sav file
    that contains many arrays as their values. These arrays will be imported
    as numpy arrays. Each key:value pair from the dictionary iterated through
    with the key acting as the file name, and the value is saved into the npy
    file. They will all be saved in a save_path, ideally this will be a data
    directory in the tests directory.

    This was made to prevent the reading of a large sav file for every test.
    This allows us to do the small tests quickly.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sav_file : Path
        The path to the save file i.e. /path/to/the/sav/file
    save_path : Path
        The path to the directory where we save all the .npy files i.e. /path/to/the/directory/where/we/want/save
        In the case the directory doesn't exist it will recursively make the directories to ensure it does.

    Raises
    ------
    OSError
        In the case the path for sav_file is not found and/or sav_file is not a file
        It will also get raised if the save_path is not a directory
